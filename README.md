This project creates a recipe book app that allows the user to check a list of recipies,
check the details of selected recipe, and mark it as favorite. The favorited recipies
should also have their own, dedicated screen, for user convenience.

# Project Requirements:
* Build a multi-screen app using Jetpack Compose.
* Use State to manage UI updates.
* Use ViewModel to store and manage data across screens.
* Use Navigation to move between screens.
* Use hardcoded data (no backend yet).
* Goal → Practice connecting all key concepts in one working app.

# Screens:
* Home → List of recipes.
* Details → Ingredients + steps.
* Favorites → Saved recipes.

* State → Mark/unmark recipes as favorite.
* ViewModel → Store recipes + favorite list.
* Navigation → Home → Details → Favorites.
